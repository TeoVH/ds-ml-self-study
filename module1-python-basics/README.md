# Module 1: Python Fundamentals

This module is the first part of my 40-week Data Science and Machine Learning learning journey. The goal of this module is to build a solid foundation in Python before working with data-focused libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, or `scikit-learn`.

Each file corresponds to a daily hands-on session, focusing on essential Python concepts through practical examples and small projects.

## Topics Covered

- Basic data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`
- Variable assignments and arithmetic operations
- User input with `input()`
- String formatting using f-strings
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Lists and basic list operations
- `for` and `while` loops
- Functions and return values
- Basic modularization and code reuse
- Dictionaries and dictionary operations
- Combined loops and conditions
- Mini-projects: calculators, menu display, GPA evaluation, temperature conversion, contact book, ATM simulation

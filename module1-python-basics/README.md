# Module 1: Python Fundamentals

This module is the first part of my 40-week Data Science and Machine Learning learning journey. The goal of this module is to build a solid foundation in Python before working with data-focused libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, or `scikit-learn`.

Each file corresponds to a daily hands-on session, focusing on essential Python concepts through practical examples and small projects.

## Topics Covered

- Basic data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`
- Variable assignments and arithmetic operations
- User input with `input()`
- String formatting using f-strings
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`

## Structure

| Day   | Content                                                                 |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Day 1 | Data types, variables, arithmetic operations, string formatting. Mini-store calculator project. |
| Day 2 | User input, conditional logic, comparison operators. Age-based pricing system project.          |
